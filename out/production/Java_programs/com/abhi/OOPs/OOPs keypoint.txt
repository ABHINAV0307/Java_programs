OOPS-1
-object are stored in heap memory and references are stored in stack memory
-dot operator/separator is used to link instance variable with reference variable
-when value is not initialised it return as null type
-All class in java may be allocated dynamically(see compile time and runtime part)
-java is static type language(if instance part is not previously declared its going to show error)
-final variables has to be initialised while declaration
-final keyword should be written in all capital
-when a non-primitive is final you cant reassign
-FINALISED is used in java as garbage collector it is mostly called automatically

OOPS-2
-Packages are container to classes
-Properties that are not directly related to the object are called Static
-Why main is declared as static?-->if it's not static you have to create object of class to run every time
-inside static you cant use anything that's not static
-you cannot use this keyword inside static class
-Static variables are class level stuff are resolved during compile time.
-Singalton class-can only create one object(done using private keyword)
